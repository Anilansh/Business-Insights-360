# Business Insights 360 Dashboard

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, visualization, and interactive dashboard creation  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and pre-processing  
- **SQL** – Data extraction and transformation

## Overview
The **Business Insights 360 Dashboard** provides a 360° view of AtliQ Hardware’s business performance across five departments — **Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive Management**.  
The goal is to empower stakeholders with data-driven decision-making through a unified Power BI platform that integrates sales, financial, and operational data.

## Process & Methodology
1. **Data Extraction:** Imported raw sales, finance, and supply chain data from Excel and SQL databases.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Transformed, standardized, and validated data using Power Query for consistency.  
3. **Data Modeling:** Designed a **Snowflake Schema** model connecting fact and dimension tables for better normalization and performance.  
4. **DAX Calculations:** Created dynamic measures for KPIs such as:
   - Net Sales
   - Gross Margin %
   - Net Profit %
   - Forecast Accuracy %
   - Market Share %  
5. **Optimization:** Used **DAX Studio** to improve performance — achieving **30% storage savings** and **10% faster load times**.  
6. **Visualization:** Designed departmental dashboards with interactive filters (Year, Quarter, YTD/YTG, Market, Region, Customer).
